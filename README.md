# ChessBoard
This program has different files for specific chess pieces and how they move on a board. Given an input file with pieces already on the chessboard
it first checks to see if the board is valid. If it is then the the program executes. We are implementing a linked list in the program.
IN the input file there are specifics to where pieces are on the board and where they attack and we print to an output after all the 
valid moves have been made, if any to being with.
